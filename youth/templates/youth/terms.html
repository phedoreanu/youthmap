<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PRINCIPLES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Principles governing the website derive from the manifesto of Youth Time International Movement available here: <a href="http://youth-time.org/manifesto">http://youth-time.org/manifesto</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that the current social, economical, political, cultural paradigm should change to a model based on humanistic values: solidarity, complementary, dialogue, freedom and respect. Among others we greatly emphasize the value of intergenerational dialogue and the importance of protecting the family as the social basic unit formed by men and woman. In this context we consider protecting the rights of children, born or unborn. Therefore we do not take any sides and do not support or encourage content related to political or military disputes as well as any ideological forms ranging from Fascism to Marxism, including cultural Marxism or any radical or extremist sexual activism (all sorts of propaganda for various groups). For this reason we reserve the right to remove any content or ban any profile not respecting these values and principles, with no obligation from our side to justify this action.</p>
